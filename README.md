This project will be using the Ising model to simulate a rapid expansion of a phase transition of water to ice. Where the speed of the freezing and the location of the freezing is totally random as in nature.
The motivation for this project is sheer boredom and also spite as I hated the Ising model in thermodynamics and I would like to return to my old bitter enemy and use it for this.
The objective would to simply get it to even replicate a freezing plane of water into ice and the questions would solve would be can the ising model be used onto phase transitions of more quantifiable things such as matter rather than using it for a poor representation of magnetization.
